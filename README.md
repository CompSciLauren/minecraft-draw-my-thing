# Minecraft Draw My Thing

This is the first side project I ever worked on. I created it in order to beat the "Draw My Thing" pictionary game that existed on a popular Minecraft server. By using this project, I was able to consistently win nearly every round of the game. I discontinued the use of it once I was finished building it because I felt it gave me an unfair advantage in the game. Building this project is what inspired me to pursue a career in computer science. It exists on GitHub for historical purposes.
